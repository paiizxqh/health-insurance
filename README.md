# Health Insurance Premium Prediction Web Application

## Project Overview

This project develops a web-based multiple linear regression model for predicting health insurance premiums. It aims to provide a user-friendly tool for individuals to estimate their health insurance costs based on various factors.

### Key Features

- Multiple Linear Regression model for accurate premium prediction
- Web-based interface for easy access and use
- Data-driven insights into factors affecting insurance premiums

## Problem Statement

The U.S. health insurance system lacks transparency in premium assessment, making it difficult for individuals to plan their finances effectively. This project addresses the need for an accessible and accurate tool for personal health insurance premium estimation.

## Goals and Objectives

1. Develop a Multiple Linear Regression model with prediction accuracy within 10% error margin.
2. Create a user-friendly web application where users can input data and receive predictions within 1 minute.
3. Make the web application publicly accessible via GitHub within 3 months of project initiation.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Analysis & Model Development**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Development**: React, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Frontend Framework**: Bootstrap
- **Version Control & Deployment**: Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook
